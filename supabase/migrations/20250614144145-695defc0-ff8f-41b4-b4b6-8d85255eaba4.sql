-- Drop existing restrictive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin can manage flights" ON public.flights;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin can manage hotels" ON public.hotels;

-- Create new policies that allow INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE for everyone
-- (since we're handling admin authentication at the application level)
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on flights" ON public.flights FOR ALL USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on hotels" ON public.hotels FOR ALL USING (true);

-- Alternatively, if you want to keep some security, you can create policies
-- that allow operations only when there's a valid admin session
-- But for simplicity, the above approach will work for your admin system
